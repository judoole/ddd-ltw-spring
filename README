This is an easy-to-get place to put my Domain Driven Design tips and tricks using Load Time Weaving with Spring

What does it do?
Just a plain index.html that sends a firstname and surname to a Spring Controller
The Spring Controller does this:
@RequestMapping(method = GET)
public ModelAndView generateName(@RequestParam("firstname") String firstname, @RequestParam("surname") String surname) {
    Person person = new Person(firstname, surname);
    return new ModelAndView("WEB-INF/jsp/generateNameView.jsp", "name", person.getFullName());
}

Magically Spring LoadTimeWeaves into the Person-object an interface that can generate Pirate-names.
This is the magic-code:
@Configurable
public class Person {
    @Autowired
    private NameGeneratorService nameGenerator;

Start the codeexample either by running jetty.sh or doing this:
export MAVEN_OPTS="-javaagent:$HOME/.m2/repository/org/springframework/spring-agent/2.5.6/spring-agent-2.5.6.jar"
mvn jetty:run
